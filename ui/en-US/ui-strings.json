      "aboutContent": "Hi everyone， I'm Yves.C， a dad from Taiwan. The inspiration for TypeSprout came from watching my kids chat with friends around the world on Roblox—I realized that typing is actually the first key for children to open up to a bigger world. So I created this web typing practice using no-code concepts + ChatGPT/AI， adding little tree growth visual feedback: with every correct keystroke， the tree grows a little， turning daily efforts into visible achievements. In terms of content， I have organized commonly used words from grades 1-6 into selectable question banks; children can practice their native language and switch to English or other languages they want to practice in Settings. These words are filtered by AI according to grade difficulty. For adults， I have prepared an extended question bank， currently including Bible API and AI-generated Bible scriptures (from free online resources， accuracy may be limited)， and I will gradually add topics like famous quotes to make practice more interesting. In TypeSprout， children will gradually accumulate points and daily efforts; the little tree on the screen will also thrive with their performance， forming a positive cycle of effort → feedback → re-engagement. I also designed a 5-day active challenge: practicing for 5 consecutive days will earn a small fruit reward. When achievements are visible， motivation will grow. This is the learning rhythm I want to share with children and you. For teachers， I added a Class function on the personal page， allowing teachers to create classes and invite classmates to participate， making practice feel more competitive. This is a small project maintained by me personally (no engineering background， mainly relying on ChatGPT/AI for guidance and collaboration). If you have suggestions or encounter problems during use， please feel free to leave a message in the GitHub issues section， and I will do my best to organize and solve them. Thank you all in advance.
